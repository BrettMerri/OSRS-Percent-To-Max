This is a super simple app that allows you to look up OSRS RSN's and see how close they are in raw xp to maxing their account. Uses OSRS's shitty highscores API (it returns data in csv format with no headers).

Clone the repo, cd into the directory, and then run the following:

```
npm install
npm start
```

OR if you want to use `yarn`:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
